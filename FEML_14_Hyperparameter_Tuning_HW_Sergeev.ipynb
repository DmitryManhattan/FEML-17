    "# Домашнее задание к лекции «Улучшение качества модели»\n",
    "\n",
    "### Цель:\n",
    "Применить на практике алгоритмы по автоматической оптимизации параметров моделей машинного обучения.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Описание задания:  \n",
    "В домашнем задании нужно решить задачу классификации наличия болезни сердца у пациентов наиболее эффективно. Данные для обучения моделей необходимо загрузить самостоятельно с сайта. Целевая переменная – наличие болезни сердца (HeartDisease). Она принимает значения 0 или 1 в зависимости от отсутствия или наличия болезни соответственно. Подробное описание признаков можно прочесть в описании датасета на сайте. Для выполнения работы не обязательно вникать в медицинские показатели.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Этапы работы:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Получите данные и загрузите их в рабочую среду. (Jupyter Notebook или другую)  \n",
    "2. Подготовьте датасет к обучению моделей:  \n",
    "    a) Категориальные переменные переведите в цифровые значения. Можно использовать pd.get_dummies, preprocessing.LabelEncoder. Старайтесь не использовать для этой задачи циклы.\n",
    "3. Разделите выборку на обучающее и тестовое подмножество. 80% данных оставить на обучающее множество, 20% на тестовое.\n",
    "4. Обучите модель логистической регрессии с параметрами по умолчанию.\n",
    "5. Подсчитайте основные метрики модели. Используйте следующие метрики и функцию: cross_validate(…, cv=10, scoring=[‘accuracy’,‘recall’,‘precision’,‘f1’])\n",
    "6. Оптимизируйте 3-4 параметра модели:  \n",
    "    a) Используйте GridSearchCV.  \n",
    "    b) Используйте RandomizedSearchCV.  \n",
    "    c) *Добавьте в п. 6b 2-5 моделей классификации и вариации их параметров.  \n",
    "    d) Повторите п. 5 после каждого итогового изменения параметров.  \n",
    "7. Сформулируйте выводы по проделанной работе:  \n",
    "    a) Сравните метрики построенных моделей.  \n",
    "    b) *Сравните с полученными результатами в домашнем задании по теме «Ансамблирование».  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Для получения зачета по этому домашнему заданию минимально необходимо:**\n",
    "- обучить одну модель классификации;\n",
    "- оптимизировать параметры, используя метод из п. 6a;\n",
    "- вывести значения метрик.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Результат:**\n",
    "- Получены знания по оптимизации параметров.\n",
    "- Форма выполнения:\n",
    "- ссылка на Jupyter Notebook, загруженный на GitHub;\n",
    "- ссылка на Google Colab;\n",
    "- файл с расширением .ipynb.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Инструменты:**\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab;\n",
    "- GitHub;\n",
    "- сайт с данными для обучения моделей.\n",
    "\n",
    "Срок выполнения: дедлайн приема решений на проверку\n",
    "\n",
    "**Рекомендации к выполнению:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Текст оформляйте в отдельной ячейке Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab в формате markdown.\n",
    "- У графиков должен быть заголовок, подписи осей, легенда (опционально). Делайте графики бОльшего размера, чем стандартный вывод, чтобы увеличить читабельность.\n",
    "- Убедитесь, что по ссылкам есть доступ на чтение/просмотр.\n",
    "- Убедитесь, что все ячейки в работе выполнены и можно увидеть их вывод без повторного запуска."
